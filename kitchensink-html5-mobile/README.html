<p>Author: Jay Balunas</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">What is it?</h2>

<p>This is your project! It&#39;s a deployable Maven 3 project to help you
get your foot in the door developing HTML5 based desktop/mobile web applications with Java EE 6
on JBoss. This project is setup to allow you to create a basic Java EE 6 application
using HTML5, jQuery Mobile, JAX-RS, CDI 1.0, EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0 and Bean Validation 1.0. It includes
a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to help 
you get your feet wet with database access in enterprise Java.</p>

<p>This application is built using a technique called Plain Old HTML5 (POH5).  This uses a pure HTML
client that interacts with with the application server via restful end-points (JAX-RS).  This
application also uses some of the latest HTML5 features and advanced JAX-RS. And since testing
is just as important with POH5 as it is server side, this application uses QUnit to show
you how to unit test your JavaScript.</p>

<p>What is a modern web application without mobile web support? This application also integrates
jQuery mobile and basic client side device detection to give you both a desktop and mobile 
version of the interface. Both support the same features, including form validation, member
registration, etc. However the mobile version adds in mobile layout, touch, and performance 
improvements needed to get you started with mobile web development on JBoss.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_2">System requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to build this project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or better, Maven
3.0 or better.</p>

<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on JBoss AS 7 or JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.</p>

<p>An HTML5 compatible browser such as Chrome, Safari 5+, Firefox 5+, or IE 9+ are
required. and note that some behaviors will vary slightly (ex. validations) based on browser support,
especially IE 9.</p>

<p>Mobile web support is limited to Android and iOS devices.  It should run on HP,
and Black Berry devices as well.  Windows Phone, and others will be supported as 
jQuery Mobile announces support.</p>

<p>With the prerequisites out of the way, you&#39;re ready to build and deploy.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Deploying the application</h2>

<h3 id="toc_4">Deploying locally</h3>

<p>First you need to start the JBoss container. To do this, run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$<span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>or if you are using windows</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$<span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">bat</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Note: Adding &ldquo;-b 0.0.0.0&rdquo; to the above commands will allow external clients (phones, tablets, 
desktops, etc&hellip;) connect through your local network.</p>

<p>For example</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>$<span class="n">JBOSS_HOME</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">bin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">standalone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">sh</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span> 0<span class="p">.</span>0<span class="p">.</span>0<span class="p">.</span>0 
</pre>
</div>

<p>To deploy the application, you first need to produce the archive to deploy using
the following Maven goal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">package</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can now deploy the artifact by executing the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The client application will be running at the following URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-kitchensink-html5-mobile/">http://localhost:8080/jboss-as-kitchensink-html5-mobile/</a>.</p>

<p>To undeploy run this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">undeploy</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>You can also start the JBoss container and deploy the project using JBoss Tools. See the
<a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Getting+Started+Developing+Applications+Guide" title="Getting Started Developing Applications Guide">Getting Started Developing Applications Guide</a> 
for more information.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Deploying to OpenShift</h3>

<p>You can also deploy the application directly to OpenShift, Red Hat&#39;s cloud based PaaS offering, follow the instructions <a href="https://community.jboss.org/wiki/DeployingHTML5ApplicationsToOpenshift">here</a></p>

<h1 id="toc_6">Minification</h1>

<p>By default, the project uses the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wro4j/">wro4j</a> plugin,
which provides the ability to concatenate, validate and minify JavaScript and CSS
files. These minified files, as well as their unmodified versions are deployed with
the project.</p>

<p>With just a few quick changes to the project, you can link to the minified versions
of your JavaScript and CSS files.</p>

<p>First, in the <project-root>/src/main/webapp/index.html file, search for
references to minification and comment or uncomment the appropriate lines.</p>

<p>Finally, wro4j runs in the compile phase so any standard build command like package,
install, etc. will trigger it. The plugin is in a profile with an id of &ldquo;minify&rdquo; so
you will want to specify that profile in your maven build.</p>

<p>NOTE: You must either specify the default profile for no tests or the arquillian test
profile to run tests when minifying to avoid test errors. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#No Tests</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Pminify</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">default</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>OR</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">#With Tests</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">package</span> <span class="n">jboss</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">as</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">deploy</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Pminify</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">arq</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jbossas</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">remote</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h1 id="toc_7">Running the Arquillian tests</h1>

<p>By default, tests are configured to be skipped. The reason is that the sample
test is an Arquillian test, which requires the use of a container. You can
activate this test by selecting one of the container configuration provided 
for JBoss.</p>

<p>To run the test in JBoss, first start the container instance. Then, run the
test goal with the following profile activated:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">clean</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Parq</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">jbossas</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">remote</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h1 id="toc_8">Running the QUnit tests</h1>

<p>QUnit is a JavaScript unit testing framework used and built by jQuery. This 
application includes a set of QUnit tests in order to verify JavaScript that
is core to this HTML5 application. Executing QUnit test cases is quite easy. First,
make sure the server is running and the project has been deployed as some of the
tests will be testing the functionality of the services. Then, simply load the
following HTML in the browser you wish to test.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">project</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="o">&gt;/</span><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">test</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">qunit</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>For more information on QUnit tests see <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit">http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit</a></p>

<h1 id="toc_9">Importing the project into an IDE</h1>

<p>If you created the project using the Maven archetype wizard in your IDE
(Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA), then there is nothing to do. You should
already have an IDE project.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions for using Eclipse / JBoss Tools with are provided in the 
<a href="https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Getting+Started+Developing+Applications+Guide" title="Getting Started Developing Applications Guide">Getting Started Developing Applications Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you created the project from the command line using archetype:generate, then
you need to import the project into your IDE. If you are using NetBeans 6.8 or
IntelliJ IDEA 9, then all you have to do is open the project as an existing
project. Both of these IDEs recognize Maven projects natively.</p>

<h1 id="toc_10">Downloading the sources and Javadocs</h1>

<p>If you want to be able to debug into the source code or look at the Javadocs
of any library in the project, you can run either of the following two
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect
them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">dependency</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">sources</span>
<span class="n">mvn</span> <span class="n">dependency</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">resolve</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Dclassifier</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="n">javadoc</span>
</pre>
</div>

<h1 id="toc_11">Development notes</h1>

<h2 id="toc_12">Copyright headers</h2>

<p>To update the copyright headers, just run <code>mvn license:format -Dyear=&lt;current year&gt;</code></p>
